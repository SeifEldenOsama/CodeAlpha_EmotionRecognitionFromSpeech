✅ Emotion Recognition from Speech
As part of my internship at CodeAlpha, I developed an AI-powered system for emotion recognition from audio signals.
The solution leverages advanced speech processing techniques and deep learning models to identify human emotions such as happiness, anger, and sadness from voice input.

Key Highlights:
✔ Implemented audio feature extraction (MFCC, spectrograms) for effective representation.
✔ Built and trained deep learning models for high-accuracy classification.
✔ Added visualization tools for analyzing model performance and predictions.
✔ Designed the system for scalability and real-time processing capability.

This project enhanced my expertise in Machine Learning, Speech Processing, and Neural Networks, contributing to building intelligent, real-world AI applications.
